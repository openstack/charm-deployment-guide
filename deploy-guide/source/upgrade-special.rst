========================
Special charm procedures
========================

Upgrades, of either of the three types, may occasionally introduce unavoidable
challenges. For instance, it could be that a charm is replaced by an entirely
new charm on a new series or a new charm is needed to accommodate a new service
on a new OpenStack release. These kinds of special procedures are documented
on this page.

See the :doc:`upgrade-overview` page for general upgrade information.
